### **IMPORTANT INFORMATION**
> - Not *EVERY* app will be compatable with this method, although all apps run through steam should be!  
>   - *(at the moment it seems that apps that connect to your browser dont seem to work for now...)*  
> - This system is CASE SENSITIVE!!! Please pay close attention to when you have to rename a file!  
>   - *(if it applies to a file the second bullet point will remind you!)*  
  
### **FOLDER SETUP**
> - Find a steam game that normally supports remote play  
>   - *(we'll refer to this as the "Host" or "Host Game")* 
> - Add it to your library and find its local files
>   - *(start from the Host's library page, click the gear icon, then the button that says "Manage", and finally click "Browse local files")*
> - Locate the Host's executable(.exe) file
>   - *(this is normally named [GAMENAME].exe but can vary!)*
> - Download the ShortcutHub.exe file and rename it to EXACTLY MATCH the previous Game's executable file
>   - *(keep in mind that this is CASE SENSITIVE, that means it must match EXACTLY including capitalization!)*
> - Finally remove all files from the GAME's folder and place the renamed ShortcutHub.exe file into the now empty folder
>   - *(if opening the Host Game from the steam library it should boot into the Shortcut Hub, if it fails then you've done somthing wrong!)*
  
### **LOADING AN APP**  
> - Create a new sub-folder in the Game's folder and rename it to "shortcuts"  
>   - *(like the ShortcutHub Re-name this folder is also CASE SENSITIVE!)*
> - Locate the app you wish to remote-play with and create a new shortcut to it  
>   - *(some apps may fail to load if its not a direct link to the app's executable(.exe) file. although this is not always the case)*
> - Move the shortcut into the shortcuts folder you made earlier  
>   - *(i... dont know how to clarify this one anymore if you mess this step up you might need to be seen for short-term memory loss)*
> - Launch the GAME from the steam library  
>   - *(opening the re-named ShortcutHub.exe file from file explorer WILL NOT ENABLE REMOTE PLAY!)*
> - Use the typeface or arrow icons to make the number at the bottom of the screen match your app's file ID  
>   - *(the "file ID" can be found just before the name of the shortcut!")*
> - Then click ENTER to load the app!  
>   - *(assuming you've setup properly, an app incompatible app will be unable to open the steam-overlay while running)*
