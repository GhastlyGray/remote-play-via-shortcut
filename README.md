### **IMPORTANT INFORMATION**
> - Not *EVERY* app will be compatable with this method, although all apps run through steam should be!  
> - This system is CAPS SENSITIVE!!! Please pay close attention to when you have to rename a file!  


### **FOLDER SETUP**
> - Find a steam game that supports remote play *(we'll use [Crashphalt](https://store.steampowered.com/app/921700?snr=5000_5100__) as an example )*

> - add it to your library and find its local files like so:

> - locate the Game's executable(.exe) file  
>   <img width="640" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8ae34e3-a118-40f0-aa68-ac775d0fc236" />

> - download the FORWARDER.exe file and rename it to EXACTLY MATCH the previous Game's executable file

> - finally remove all files from the GAME's folder and place the renamed forwarder into the now empty folder

### LOADING AN APP  
> - create a shortcut leading to the executable(.exe) file of the app you wish to run

> - place the shortcut into the GAME's folder

> - rename the shortcut to Game (or Game.lnk if the file extension shows up for you!)

> - finally click play from the GAME's steam library page!

> - to swap out apps just repeat these steps!
