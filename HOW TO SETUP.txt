IMPORTANT NOTES
	Not EVERY file will be compatable with this method!
	This system is CAPS SENSITIVE!!! Please pay close attention to rename a file!

First Time Setup
	Find a steam game with remote play,
		(this tutorial was made using Crashphalt, but should work for any steam game with remote play!)
	add it to your library, and find it in your games list,
	click the gear icon, then under "Manage" click "Browse local files" this will be our "Host" folder
		(DO NOT RENAME IT!)
	find the host game's executeable(.exe) file and copy it's name
	Then download the FORWARDER.exe file from Github and rename it to match the Host folder's executeable file
	afterwards, completly empty the host folder and place the newly renamed FORWARDER.exe file into it
	then proceed to the next section

Adding/ Swapping Out Games
	Find the game that you'd like to remote play with
	create a shortcut to the game
	rename the shortcut to "game"
		making a game shortcut normally takes the file extension along with the name
			if the shortcut ends with ".lnk" then ensure the files full name should be "Game.lnk"
			otherwise the shortcut should just be named "Game" without any file extension
	then finally place the shortcut into the Host folder

Joining/ Adding Friends
	Activate the steam overlay in-game (Default keybind is SHIFT + TAB)
	find and enable the "Remote Play Together" Tab
		(this tab may already be opened for you!)
	then you can either,
		click the "Invite a Friend" button
		then select all friends you wish to invite
		after making your selection press confirm
		then have your friends click the invite sent into their direct messages!
	or,
		click "Invite a Guest" once per player
		afterwards copy each link and one link to each player
		once they click the link they will be automatically connected to the room as a guest!
